        <h1>A fantastical adventure</h1>
        <p>When I go to the arcade with my <span class="pluralNoun1"></span> there are lots of games to play. I spend lots of time there with my friends. In "Xmen" you can be different <span class="pluralNoun2"></span>. The point of the game is to <span class="verb1"></span> every robot. You also need to save people, and then you can go to the next level. In "Star Wars" you are Luke Skywalker and you try to destroy every <span class="noun1"></span>. In a car racing / motorcycle racing game you need to beat every computerized vehicle that you are <span class="ingVerb"></span> against. There are a whole lot of other cool games. When you play some games you win <span class="pluralNoun3"></span> for certain scores. Once you're done you can cash in your tickets to get a big <span class="noun2"></span>. You can save your <span class="pluralNoun3"></span> for another time. When I went to this arcade I didn't believe how much fun it would be. You might annoy your parents by asking them over and over if you can go back to there. So far I have had a lot of fun every time I've been to this great arcade! </p>
